Cookie Setup Guide for Enhanced Video Download

This script helps you set up browser cookies for better video download success rates,
especially for YouTube which has become more restrictive.

IMPORTANT: You need to export your browser cookies to a file named "cookies.txt"
in the project root directory.

Methods to get cookies.txt:

1. BROWSER EXTENSION (Recommended):
   - Chrome: Install "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension
   - Firefox: Install "cookies.txt" extension
   - Visit YouTube while logged in
   - Click the extension and export cookies for youtube.com
   - Save as "cookies.txt" in this project directory

2. MANUAL EXTRACTION:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to youtube.com while logged in
   - Go to Application/Storage tab > Cookies > https://youtube.com
   - Copy all cookies to a text file in Netscape cookie format

3. AUTOMATIC (if supported):
   - The bot will try to automatically use browser cookies
   - This may not work on all systems

COOKIES.TXT FORMAT:
The file should look like this:
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1234567890	cookie_name	cookie_value
...

SECURITY NOTE:
- Never share your cookies.txt file
- Add cookies.txt to .gitignore
- Regenerate cookies periodically for security
